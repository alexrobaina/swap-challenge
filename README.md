# Swap challenge

Swap Challenge is a single-page application (SPA) built using ReactJS and Vite.js, simulating cryptocurrency token swapping. Users can select and "swap" mock tokens like Uniswap's swap interface.

### Features

I added custom hooks like useSwap, useSendTrasaction, useScreenWidth, useGetTokens, useCalculateUsdValue
I added several component test vite vitest (It is like a jest) and react testing library.
Token Selection: Users can choose a 'From' token and a 'To' token from dropdown menus with predefined mock tokens such as BTC, ETH, and LTC.
Amount Input: An input field is provided for users to specify the amount of the 'From' token they wish to swap, with an estimated amount of the 'To' token displayed.
Swap Button: A button to initiate the swap action, simulating the process with a mock API call.

### Deployment
The application is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed [Swap-challenge](https://swap-challenge.vercel.app/)
